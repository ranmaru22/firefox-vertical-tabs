* Firefox Vertical Tabs
Vertical tabs for Firefox, inspired by Edge. Works with Light theme, Dark theme,
and System theme (auto dark mode). There are some minor glitches with Alpenglow
but they should be easy to fix.

It also plays nice with Container Tabs.

** Compatibility
*Guarateed compatibility with Firefox 107.*

There has recently been in change in Firefox that requires the use of
~-moz-platform~ instead of ~-moz-os-version~ to use OS-specific CSS. This will work
from 99.0b1 upwards but might not on older versions, so be aware of that. If you
run an older version of Firefox and have an issue, change this back.

(Also, since the only OS-specific CSS in the file targets Windows, it should not
affect you on Mac or Linux either way.)

It should work on newer versions as well unless there's any breaking changes in
how ~userChrome.css~ works.

I have only tested this for Linux and macOS. There might be some bugs on Windows
because the window decorations look different. I can't test this because I don't
have a Windows computer, but if you find any bugs and know how to fix it, feel
free to submit a PR.

** How to install
- Go to ~about:config~ in your URL bar, search for
  ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Go to ~about:profiles~ in your URL bar, click /"Open Directory"/ next to your Root
  Directory under your default profile.
- If there is no ~chrome~ folder, create it.
- Create a file called ~userChrome.css~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Copy and paste the contents of ~userChrome.css~ into your file (or symlink it).
- OPTIONAL: Adjust ~--delay~ setting in the ~userChrome.css~ file.
- Install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/][Tab Center Reborn]] extension.
- Make sure to enable /"Allow this extension to run in Private windows"/ so you're
  not left stranded while browsing.
- Go to ~about:addons~ in your URL bar, select *Tab Center Reborn*, go to
  *Preferences* and set:
  - *Animations*: on.
  - *Use current browser theme*: on, if you want to use dark mode.
  - *Compact Mode*: either "Dynamic" or "Enabled". It works with "Disabled" too
    but looks nicer with only favicons.
  - *Favicon-only pinned tabs*: off.
  - Activate *Custom Stylesheet* and paste the contents of ~tabCenterReborn.css~
    into the text area below, and click "Save CSS" under the text box.
- Restart Firefox.

** Things to note
- If the sidebar does not show up, you can press =Shift-F1= to show the Tab
  Center Reborn sidebar directy, or =Cmd-B= / =Ctrl-B= to toggle the sidebar in
  general.
- In Fullscreen mode, the sidebar will collapse to a 1px wide border instead to
  be as unintrusive as possible. You can expand it by pushing your cursor all
  the way to the edge of the screen.
